# Priority Matrix - Task Prioritization

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Created:** October 20, 2025
**Purpose:** Prioritize remaining tasks by urgency and importance

---

## Priority Classification System

### P0 - Critical (MUST have before launch)
Blockers for production launch. System cannot go live without these.

### P1 - High (SHOULD have for good UX)
Important for user experience but not blocking. Can be added shortly after launch if time-constrained.

### P2 - Medium (NICE to have)
Enhances experience but not essential for MVP. Can be added in v1.1.

### P3 - Low (Future enhancements)
Nice-to-have features for future versions.

## Priority Rationale

### Why P0 is Critical

1. **Testing:** Cannot launch without knowing if system works
2. **Security:** Legal liability and reputation risk
3. **Deployment:** Cannot launch without infrastructure
4. **Monitoring:** Cannot operate without visibility
5. **Error Handling:** Cannot have white screen crashes

**Risk of Skipping:** System launch blocked, security breach, data loss, user frustration

### Why P1 is High Priority

1. **PDF/Email:** Core features users expect
2. **Load Testing:** Prevents launch day disasters
3. **QA:** Catches bugs before users do
4. **Documentation:** Reduces support burden

**Risk of Skipping:** Incomplete feature set, poor user experience, high support costs

### Why P2 is Medium Priority

1. **UI Polish:** Nice but not essential for MVP
2. **Advanced Features:** Power users will ask for these
3. **Security Enhancements:** Good to have, not immediate risk

**Risk of Skipping:** Less professional appearance, some user frustration, but system is usable

### Why P3 is Low Priority

1. **Advanced Features:** Valuable for growth, not MVP
2. **Business Features:** Scale concerns, not immediate
3. **Polish:** Diminishing returns

**Risk of Skipping:** None for initial launch. Add based on user feedback.

## Prioritization Decision Framework

When deciding whether to include a feature, ask:

### 1. Does it block launch?
- **Yes:** P0
- **No:** Continue to next question

### 2. Will users immediately notice it's missing?
- **Yes:** P1
- **No:** Continue to next question

### 3. Does it prevent a common user task?
- **Yes:** P1
- **No:** Continue to next question

### 4. Does it significantly enhance user experience?
- **Yes:** P2
- **No:** Continue to next question

### 5. Is it a differentiator from competitors?
- **Yes:** P2
- **No:** Continue to next question

### 6. Will it drive growth or revenue?
- **Yes:** P2
- **No:** P3

---

## Priority Adjustments

### Situations That May Increase Priority:

1. **User Feedback:** If beta users strongly request a P2 feature
2. **Competitive Pressure:** Competitor launches similar feature
3. **Legal/Compliance:** New regulation requires feature
4. **Security:** New vulnerability discovered
5. **Bug Severity:** Critical bug found in P3 feature

### Situations That May Decrease Priority:

1. **Timeline Pressure:** Need to launch sooner
2. **Resource Constraints:** Not enough developer time
3. **Low Usage:** Feature not being used in beta
4. **Technical Debt:** Needs refactoring first
5. **Dependencies:** Waiting on third-party integration

## Stakeholder Communication

### What to Communicate:

**To Users:**
- P0 items: "System is stable and secure"
- P1 items: "Core features are complete"
- P2 items: "Coming soon: [features]"
- P3 items: "On our roadmap: [features]"

**To Management:**
- P0 items: "Required for launch"
- P1 items: "Recommended for launch"
- P2 items: "Post-launch enhancements"
- P3 items: "Future product roadmap"

**To Development Team:**
- P0 items: "Drop everything else if needed"
- P1 items: "High priority, schedule accordingly"
- P2 items: "Fill in gaps, don't block launch"

## Conclusion

### Recommended Approach: **Option 1 - Full Feature MVP (4 weeks)**

**Rationale:**
1. PDF and Email are core features users expect
2. Load testing prevents disaster on launch day
3. Proper QA reduces support burden
4. Documentation enables self-service
5. Professional polish increases credibility

**Trade-off:**
- One extra week of development
- More thorough testing
- Better first impression
- Lower churn rate

**Alternative:** If timeline pressure is extreme, proceed with Option 2 (Quick Launch MVP) but plan immediate follow-up releases for P1 items within 1-2 weeks of launch.

**Not Recommended:** Option 3 (Bare Minimum MVP) risks launching an incomplete product that frustrates users and damages reputation.
