# Immediate Action Plan - Start Testing TODAY

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Created:** October 20, 2025
**For:** Testing Agent (Level 3)
**Priority:** P0 - CRITICAL
**Timeline:** Start immediately, complete in 2-4 hours

---

## Mission

You are the **Level 3 Testing Agent**. Your mission is to validate that the OpenAsApp Quote Management System works as designed, before any further development proceeds.

**Why This Matters:**
- Confirms the system is functional
- Identifies any critical bugs early
- Validates development work quality
- Provides baseline for future testing
- Prevents wasted effort on broken code

---

## Prerequisites Checklist

Before starting, verify you have:
- [ ] Windows machine or compatible environment
- [ ] Git installed
- [ ] Node.js 18+ installed (`node --version`)
- [ ] Docker installed (or PostgreSQL 14+)
- [ ] Terminal/Command Prompt access
- [ ] Internet connection
- [ ] Text editor for documenting findings

**If missing any prerequisites, install them first.**

---

## Phase 1: Environment Setup (30 minutes)

### Step 1.1: Start PostgreSQL Database

**Option A: Docker (Recommended)**

Open Command Prompt or PowerShell:

```bash
# Start PostgreSQL container
docker run --name openasapp-postgres ^
  -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres ^
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres ^
  -e POSTGRES_DB=openasapp_quotes ^
  -p 5432:5432 ^
  -d postgres:16-alpine

# Verify container is running
docker ps | findstr openasapp-postgres
```

**Expected Output:** Container ID and status "Up"

**Option B: Local PostgreSQL**

If you already have PostgreSQL installed:

```bash
# Connect to your PostgreSQL instance
psql -U postgres

# Create database
CREATE DATABASE openasapp_quotes;

# Exit psql
\q
```

### Step 1.2: Navigate to Project Directory

```bash
cd C:\Users\scott\Claude_Code\OpenAsApp_App
```

### Step 1.3: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

**Expected Output:** Successful installation of ~200 packages
**Time:** ~5 minutes
**If Errors:** Note them in your report, but continue if possible

### Step 1.4: Setup Database

```bash
# Generate Prisma Client
npm run prisma:generate

# Create database tables
npm run prisma:migrate
# When prompted for migration name, enter: "init"

# Seed database with lookup tables and sample data
npm run prisma:seed
```

**Expected Output:**
```
üå± Starting database seed...
üìä Seeding lookup tables...
  ‚úì Seeded 12 cost basis factors
  ‚úì Seeded 12 zip code factors
  ‚úì Seeded 12 sqft factors
  ‚úì Seeded 12 acres factors
  ‚úì Seeded 10 property type factors
  ‚úì Seeded 12 floors factors
  ‚úì Seeded 7 multiple properties factors
  ‚úì Seeded 6 depreciation rates
  ‚úì Seeded 5 system configs
üë§ Seeding sample users...
  ‚úì Created admin user: admin@openasapp.com
  ‚úì Created demo user: demo@openasapp.com
üìã Seeding sample quote...
  ‚úì Created sample quote
‚úÖ Database seed completed successfully!
```

**If Errors:**
- Check DATABASE_URL in `.env.local`
- Verify PostgreSQL is running
- Check firewall isn't blocking port 5432

### Step 1.5: Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

**Expected Output:**
```
- ready started server on 0.0.0.0:3000, url: http://localhost:3000
- event compiled client and server successfully
```

**Test:** Open browser to http://localhost:3000
**Expected:** Page loads without errors

**If Port 3000 is busy:**
```bash
# Windows: Find and kill process on port 3000
netstat -ano | findstr :3000
taskkill /PID [PID] /F

# Then restart: npm run dev
```
