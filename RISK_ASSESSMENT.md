} catch (error) {
  logger.warn('Resend failed, trying SendGrid');
  await sendgrid.send(email);
}
```

**Redis Outage (Rate Limiting):**
```typescript
// Graceful degradation - allow requests without rate limiting
try {
  const { success } = await rateLimit(ip);
  if (!success) return 429;
} catch (error) {
  logger.error('Rate limit check failed', error);

## Risk Acceptance Statement

### Accepted Risks

**The following risks are accepted for MVP launch:**

1. **No 2FA:** Accept for MVP, plan for Phase 2
2. **No email verification:** Accept for MVP, plan for Phase 2
3. **Limited caching:** Accept for MVP, add if performance issues
4. **Single region deployment:** Accept for MVP, expand if needed

**Rationale:** These risks have low probability/impact and acceptable mitigations exist. Delaying launch to address them provides diminishing returns.
