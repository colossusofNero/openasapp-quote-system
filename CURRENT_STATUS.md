## 🔄 In Progress

### Waiting for User Input

**1. Excel Quote File ⏳**
- **Need:** Your Excel-based OpenAsApp quote file
- **Purpose:** Analyze structure and replicate formulas
- **Location:** Please copy to `reference/OpenAsApp_Quote_Template.xlsx`
- **Once Provided:** We'll analyze and document:
  - Cell structure and layout
  - Formula logic
  - Calculation rules
  - Validation requirements

**2. Sample PDFs (Optional)**
- **Need:** Example quote PDFs you commonly work with
- **Purpose:** Test and refine PDF parser for your specific formats
- **Location:** `reference/sample-pdfs/`

---

## ⏭️ Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Once Excel File Provided)

#### 1. Analyze Excel File
```bash
# You'll copy file to:
C:\Users\scott\Claude_Code\OpenAsApp_App\reference\OpenAsApp_Quote_Template.xlsx

# We'll document:
- Formula structure
- Calculation logic
- Cell dependencies
- Business rules
```

#### 2. Initialize Project
```bash
cd C:\Users\scott\Claude_Code\OpenAsApp_App

# Install Next.js with TypeScript
npx create-next-app@latest . --typescript --tailwind --app --src-dir --import-alias "@/*"

# Install dependencies
npm install @prisma/client prisma
npm install next-auth
npm install pdf-parse exceljs
npm install zod react-hook-form @hookform/resolvers/zod zustand
npm install --save-dev @types/pdf-parse @types/next-auth
```

#### 3. Integrate PDF Parser
```bash
# Create parser directory
mkdir -p src/lib/pdf-parser

# Copy and adapt the working parser from RCGV_CapEx_Parse
# Enhance for quote-specific parsing
```

#### 4. Implement Excel Logic
```bash
# Create Excel compatibility layer
mkdir -p src/lib/excel-compat

# Replicate formulas and calculations
```

## 🚀 What Happens Next

### Option 1: Provide Excel File Now
**Timeline:** Fastest path
1. Copy Excel file to `reference/` folder
2. We analyze structure and formulas
3. Initialize project with complete schema
4. Start development immediately

**Advantages:**
- Complete understanding of requirements upfront
- Database schema matches Excel structure
- No rework needed later

### Option 2: Start Without Excel File
**Timeline:** Slower, with potential rework
1. Initialize project with generic quote schema
2. Build basic quote functionality
3. Integrate Excel file later when provided
4. Potentially refactor to match Excel logic

**Advantages:**
- Can start development immediately
- Basic functionality available sooner

**Disadvantages:**
- May need to refactor later
- Database schema might need changes
- Potential rework of calculation logic

## 🎯 Recommended Path Forward

### My Recommendation: **Option 1** (Wait for Excel File)

**Reasoning:**
1. **Better Architecture:** Design database to match your Excel structure from day 1
2. **Accurate Formulas:** Replicate your exact calculation logic
3. **No Rework:** Avoid refactoring later
4. **Faster Overall:** Even though we wait, total time is less
5. **Better UX:** Users get familiar interface that matches Excel

### While We Wait, You Can:

1. **Review Documentation:**
   - Read through all the specifications
   - Understand the agent hierarchy
   - Review the 12-week timeline
   - Familiarize yourself with the tech stack

2. **Set Up Accounts:**
   - Create Vercel account (if not already)
   - Set up GitHub repository
   - Get OpenAI API key (for ChatGPT integration)

3. **Gather Requirements:**
   - Think about what Excel features are most important
   - Identify any pain points with current Excel workflow
   - List any features you'd like to add that Excel doesn't have

4. **Collect Test Data:**
   - Gather sample PDFs (redact sensitive info)
   - Document edge cases or unusual quotes
   - Note any specific business rules
